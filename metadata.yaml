description: Gregg Haljan was aware that there was a certain danger in having the
  giant spaceship Planetara stop off at the moon to pick up Grantline's special cargo
  of moon ore. For that rare metal--invaluable in keeping Earth's technology running--was
  the target of many greedy eyes. But nevertheless he hadn't figured on the special
  twist the clever Martian brigands would use. So when he found both the ship and
  himself suddenly in their hands, he knew that there was only one way in which he
  could hope to save that cargo and his own secret--that would be by turning space-pirate
  himself and paying the brigands of the moon back in their own interplanetary coin.
  Here is a science-fiction classic, as exciting and ingenious as only a master of
  super-science could write.
